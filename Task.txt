Your task is to implement your own HashMap.

Methods that you will need to include are: 
- put, adding the stuff into the hashmap
- get, returns value of the given key
- print, prints the whole hashmap
- contains key, returns if the hashmap contains mapping for the key
- contains value, returns if this map maps one or more keys to the specific value
- remove, removes the mapping for the specified key
- clear, removes all of the mappings 

*** Before you start coding, you should learn about Generics***
